# RL Algorithms
Contains the implementation of various RL frameworks for a 100x100 Grid World with obstacles in between 2 random points. 
- Built an MDP based RL agent to optimise both policies and actions at every state and benchmarked results of MDP method with Q-Learning results for the same problem.

## Results
### Markov Decision Process
```Training time: 59.33 seconds```
```Mean reward: -97.00```

### Q-Learning
```Training time: 379.71 seconds```
```Mean reward: -1000.00```
